Independent processes:

designing
deep analysis
security and performance
product management*

main processes:

planning and documenting*
testing*
coding and refactoring
logging
debugging

sub processes:

gitting
setting and maintaining transportability
setting and maintaining co-functionality
setting and maintaining development environment
adapting to coding environment (data storage, input-output, library, language,
project structure)
security measures


main process > planning and documenting:

getting and storing the user requirements*
doing and writing down analysis, problem solving, ux design

main process > testing:

satisfying user requirements*
proofing the code logic

main process > coding and refactoring:

writting tests
transfering knowledge into code
styling the code
structuring the code
enabling logging
fixing bugs

main process > logging:

tracking the computing processes
tracking the application usage

main process > debugging:

finding language or environment related errors
finding logical errors


note: * at the ending of any line means that the process requires the product
manager and all others primarily requires the developers(except the independent
processes, which may be done by specialists such as data scientists, designers,
system engineers in addition to the developers).
note: main processes all together involve in developing any piece of an app.
note: sub processes are considered project specific constants that shall be
followed mostly during the initialisation or at the end of the project
development.
note: independent processes are considered to be done and can influence the
project development at any point during the development.
