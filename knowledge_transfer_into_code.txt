   Writing primitive operations on primitive data types, using storage or
chaining small processes together for forming continued processes, using logical
decisions for directing the path of the process, using looping, recursion,
creating new operations and data structures and using them.

   Making use of algorithms.

   Receiving input and producing output.

   Storage and maintanance of input or cached output data.

   Arithmatics, Boolean Logic, String operations (including regular language
processing), data storage and operations (variables, lists, dicts, etc).

   Identifying and implementing logical structure to the code (functions,
classes)
